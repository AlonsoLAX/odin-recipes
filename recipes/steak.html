        <h3>Steak on stovetop</h3>

        <p>This is one of my favorite recipes to enjoy after a long weekend. A delicious and aromantic steak recipe, yet simple with common ingridients. </p>
        <p>Cooking steak on the stovetop is one of my go-to preparations for a quick and easy weeknight dinner. It can get the house smokey, but stovetop steak is easier than fussing with an outdoor grill and provides just as good, if not better, results. Just make sure you turn on the exhaust hood and open a window</p>
